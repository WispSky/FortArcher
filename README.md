 A Minecraft Base-Building PvP Minigame

### How To Play
Start with a void world for the best experience.
Have each player in creative mode and separate from each other at least 30 blocks away.
/build will create a (very bad) default base. The player can change everything about the base as long as they stay within the size of the default base. Anything outside the default size will not be saved. The walls/floor/ceiling can all be changed as well, and it is encouraged.
Typing /build for the second time will save and remove the base.

Now you're ready to play! /fight <name> will send a request to the targeted player who can click the message they receive, or send the same command with the challenger's name. The default map (called islands) will be spawned, along with the players' respective bases. A point is gained by killing the opponent (falling into the void will not count as a point.) Points are also gainable by capturing the flag behind the opponent's base and bringing it to the flag behind their own base.

### TO-DO
`-` Config file<br>
`-` Set gamemodes to creative when building and survival when a game begins<br>
`-` MORE MAPS<br>
`-` Better default base<br>

### Known Bugs
`-` Flag does not reset when falling into the void with it. (Definitely overlooked this one when adding teleportation from the void)<br>
